            <p>In this step you will be able to add any fit you want to include in your personal fittings. They will be easy to use in your shopping lists and you will need to import them only once.</p>
            <p>Copy in the clipboard your fitting and paste in the text area contained in the left panel of this screen.</p>
            <p>The format recognised are <strong>EVE XML (recommended format)</strong>, EFT and DNA.</p>
            <p>It is possible to import fits in different ways:</p>
            <p>- Inside Eve: Drag your fit to any eve chat, enter the fit in the chat and copy the message line that includes the link (you need to actually enter the fit in the chat, is not enough to drag it and copy, need to drag and press enter in the chat). This will provide a DNA fit that you can paste in our text area. Don't need to remove user name or anything, eve-shopping will just ignore it. See a video here (add link to video).</p>
            <p>- Export fits from EVE to xml in the EVE Docs folder. You can open the XML file with your favorite editor, copy the content and paste it to our text area. See a video here (add link to video).</p>
            <p>- From your favorite EVE fitting tool, like EFT, Pyfa or EVEHQ. These tools have many ways to export their fits or copy them to clipboard. If you have the chance, export it to the prefered format: XML.</p>
            <p>Once your fit is analysed, you can use it in your shopping list and set the units that you want to buy.</p>
